 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing sales data from Blinkit (formerly Grofers) to uncover insights about product performance, pricing trends, and customer purchasing behavior.
Using Python’s data analytics libraries, I explored, cleaned, and visualized the dataset to make data-driven business recommendations.

Objective

The main goal of this analysis is to:

Identify factors that impact sales performance.

Find correlations between item visibility, MRP, outlet type, and total sales.

Provide actionable insights for improving overall sales and outlet strategy.

Key Insights

 Outlets located in Tier 3 cities have lower average sales compared to Tier 1 & 2.
 Fat-content items contribute significantly to total sales.
 Supermarket Type 1 outlets outperform others in total sales volume.
 Items with higher visibility often don’t guarantee higher sales — pricing strategy plays a bigger role.

 Dashboard / Visualizations

Sales distribution by outlet size and type

Item visibility vs sales
